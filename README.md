This is TOP's Rock Paper Scissors javascript exercise

I will begin by playing the game in the browser console. Date started: 9.6.2022

A GUI will be added at a later date. 

Date: 9.15.2022 - I am putting the console version to rest for now. I will continue to think about how to add a scoring system for the end of the game.
